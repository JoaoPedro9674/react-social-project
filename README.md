If you're here, you're probably reading [_React in Action_](https://ifelse.io/book) by, well, me ( [@markthethomas](https://github.com/markthethomas)) ðŸ˜€! I hope you're enjoying learning about React so far! We'll be working through each part of the project as we move through it in the book, but you can find the complete project here for reference. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to reach out to me @markthethomas ( [blog](https://ifelse.io), [twitter](https://twitter.com/MarkTheThomas), [github](https://github.com/markthethomas)) pretty much anywhere.

â€” Mark
